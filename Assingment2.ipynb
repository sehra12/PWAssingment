    "# Q1. How do you comment code in Python? What are the different types of comments?\n",
    "## Ans1) To Write a comment in python, we can use hash mark (#) before our desired comment . Python ignores everything after hash mark (#).\n",
    "# Types Of Comment\n",
    "##  1) Single -Line Comment--- These comments start with a hash mark (#) and continue until the end of the line. They are used to explain code or to make notes for yourself or other developers who might read your code later.\n",
    "##  2) Multi-line comments---- These comments start and end with three quotes (“”\"). They are used to explain larger blocks of code or to create documentation strings (docstrings) for functions, modules, or classes.\n",
    "##  3) Inline - comments---- These comments are placed on the same line as a statement and are separated from the statement by at least two spaces. They are used to explain specific parts of a statement"

    "# Q2. What are variables in Python? How do you declare and assign values to variables?\n",
    "## Ans)  Variable is a container for storing data values. You can think of variables as a way to label data with a descriptive name so that you can use it later in your code.  To declare a variable in Python, you don’t need to use any special command. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. Here’s an example"

Complex numbers are used in mathematics, especially where square roots of negative numbers are involved . In Python, complex numbers can be created from two real numbers and an imaginary number that is the square root of -1. They can be written in the form of (x + yj) where x and y are real numbers and j is an imaginary number"
